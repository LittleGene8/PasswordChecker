# PasswordChecker

This project can take any password and can tell you if you need to change the password or not. This is made possible by an API of pwnedpasswordcheck, which provides the project with the key information it needs. This API has a list of passwords that have been leaked, and the number of times that they have been leaked. Using this information, if your password has been leaked, this program will identify it and notify you.
